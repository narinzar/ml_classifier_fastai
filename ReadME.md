# Image Classifier with fastai

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a detailed guide to building an image classifier using the fastai library. The notebook covers key concepts such as data preprocessing, transfer learning, fine-tuning, and model evaluation.

## How to Open the Notebook in Google Colab

1. **Upload the Notebook to Google Drive**:
   - Save the `image_classifier.ipynb` file to your local machine.
   - Upload the file to your Google Drive.

2. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Click on the "File" menu in the top-left corner.
   - Select "Locate" and then "Upload".
   - Click on the "Choose File" button and select the `image_classifier.ipynb` file from your local machine.
   - Alternatively, you can click on the "Google Drive" tab on the left sidebar, navigate to the location where you uploaded the file, and click on it to open.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, you can run the cells by clicking on the "Run" button (a play icon) in the top-left corner of each cell or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Notebook Content

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Install the fastai library and its dependencies.

2. **Getting the Data**:
   - Download and extract the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.

3. **Understanding Your Data: Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Explore the dataset to understand the number of images, class distribution, and image dimensions.

4. **Data Preprocessing and DataLoaders**:
   - Create DataLoaders to handle the data pipeline, including loading images in batches, applying transformations, and splitting data into training and validation sets.

5. **Understanding Transfer Learning and Model Architecture**:
   - Learn about transfer learning and the architecture of the ResNet34 model.

6. **Training the Model: Understanding Fine-Tuning**:
   - Train the model using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques.

7. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix, top losses analysis, and most confused classes.

8. **Making Predictions and Using the Model**:
   - Make predictions on new images using the trained model.

9. **Practical Exercise: Building Your Own Classifier**:
   - Put it all together to build a simple pet classifier.

10. **Advanced Techniques for Improving Performance**:
    - Explore advanced techniques such as using different architectures, progressive resizing, and test time augmentation (TTA).
